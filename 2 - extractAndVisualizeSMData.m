    % - This script is designed for the visual inspection of soil moisture data across different sites in the "SiteAll" database. 
    % 
    % - It also provides a visualization of the relationship between soil moisture and the critical threshold Î¸_cri.
    % 
    % - The user is required to manually input three variables: Site_Name, check_element, and theta_crisis.
    %
    % - Site_Name refers to the name assigned to each site within the SiteAll database.
    %
    % - The SiteAll database is a master structure composed of multiple site-specific structures. 
    %   Each site structure includes geographic coordinates, yearly records, timestamps in datetime format, 
    %   daily averaged data, and corresponding element names.
    %
    % - The check_element corresponds to the element name in the SiteAll database, such as SW0.1 or SW0.2, 
    %   which represent soil moisture at depths of 10 cm and 20 cm, respectively.
    %
    % - The theta_crisis value is determined in advance using the script "1 - theta_cri_determination.m".
    % 
    % - The results returned by this function are subsequently used as input for "3 - analyzeESmrprecEffect.m" 
    %   to compute E_SMR and E_prec through the partitioning of spring soil moisture amplification.
